[What is GraphQL?](https://dgraph.io/blog/post/what-is-gql/):  
- mutations instead of put/post
- rest has limited scope creating an API problem
- the schema and the resolver are the key components for graphql
- adding [graphql subscriptions to your react app](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/subscriptions/)

- the disadvantages of graphql
  - applying rate limiting is harder
  - always return a 200 response
  - harder to maintain because data changes
  - subject to ddos attacks if recursive and deeply nested queries are not discouraged
